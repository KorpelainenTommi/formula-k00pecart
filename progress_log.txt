20.2 - 28.2 Prep work, creating visual assets, base structure //DONE
1.3 - 7.3 Templates for Screens, Screen transitioning, Swing boilerplate //DONE
8.3 - 14.3 Track file and settings structure, IO, V2D and other utility classes //DONE
15.3 - 29.3 Rendering system for game, swing layouts for screens ready //DONE (but some parts of the rendering system could be reworked, as road rendering is a bit buggy)
30.3 - 6.4 Game logic, testing and tweaking //TODO at the moment: detect when a player is on the road, implement checkpoints and keep track of time. Win condition for race
7.4 - 15.4 Track tool

31.3
-Added DemoTrack.trck, which is the first track with correct path data for the track (added to the track file manually). Path data will be added to a track file
when it is created with the track tool, but since the track tool hasn't yet been created, paths must me added to a track file by hand.
DemoTrack.trck will be used as the main track file for testing gamelogic and new features. Other track files will have path data added, when it becomes necessary to test
features on different track layouts.

-Game logic and rendering loop is implemented and working correctly.
-RenderTarget chain is implemented and working as intended, more rendertargets will be added
(currently the game has rendering for the ground, the sky, players, the minimap, and a mostly working road render system. There are also some debug rendering for showing
cameras and other info on the minimap, this makes it easier to verify that the camera is rendering the road and object correctly)
-Handling player controls is implemented and working correctly, player movement is implemented and working correctly
-The timing system for game logic is implemented and working correctly. Currently, the timing system is implemented using System.nanoTime()
Player movement (movement speed, turning speed etc.) is independent from frame rate.
-Some parts of the code could use refactoring and maintenance

-Project is progressing at the expected rate, and is on schedule.




17.3
-Vector and IO classes tested and implemented. 
File structures can be handled in a fairly straight forward manner, since IO can serialize/deserialize Doubles, Ints and Strings in a robust way. 
Image and font loading, as well as IO exception handling is working properly

-Most Basic GUI code is done, implementing final GUI layouts is underway. 

-Some rendering systems can be implemented in a simpler/faster way than proposed in the original plan
(but if this fails, we go with the original plan)

-Project is slightly behind schedule, but is progressing fine
