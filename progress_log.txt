14.4
-Less work has been done than expected because of other ongoing courses, but after 16.4, there will be more time for this project
-Switching up the order of implementation, work has been started on the track tool, to speed up later implementing the rest of the game functionality
(more playable track files helps with testing, especially with the computer controlled player. The track tool allows creating varied, and intentionally
difficult tracks for the AI, to catch problems easier)

-Project is currently behind schedule, but should get caught up during the time period between 16.4 - 22.4
-In order to properly finish coding the project, slightly less time will be allocated for documentation (from 9 days allocated, to 6 days allocated)

-Scheduling changes like this were expected when planning, which is why a lot of time was reserved for finishing up and documenting the project







31.3
-Added DemoTrack.trck, which is the first track with correct path data for the track (added to the track file manually). Path data will be added to a track file
when it is created with the track tool, but since the track tool hasn't yet been created, paths must me added to a track file by hand.
DemoTrack.trck will be used as the main track file for testing gamelogic and new features. Other track files will have path data added, when it becomes necessary to test
features on different track layouts.

-Game logic and rendering loop is implemented and working correctly.
-RenderTarget chain is implemented and working as intended, more rendertargets will be added
(currently the game has rendering for the ground, the sky, players, the minimap, and a mostly working road render system. There are also some debug rendering for showing
cameras and other info on the minimap, this makes it easier to verify that the camera is rendering the road and object correctly)
-Handling player controls is implemented and working correctly, player movement is implemented and working correctly
-The timing system for game logic is implemented and working correctly. Currently, the timing system is implemented using System.nanoTime()
Player movement (movement speed, turning speed etc.) is independent from frame rate.
-Some parts of the code could use refactoring and maintenance

-Project is progressing at the expected rate, and is on schedule.





17.3
-Vector and IO classes tested and implemented. 
File structures can be handled in a fairly straight forward manner, since IO can serialize/deserialize Doubles, Ints and Strings in a robust way. 
Image and font loading, as well as IO exception handling is working properly

-Most Basic GUI code is done, implementing final GUI layouts is underway. 

-Some rendering systems can be implemented in a simpler/faster way than proposed in the original plan
(but if this fails, we go with the original plan)

-Project is slightly behind schedule, but is progressing fine
